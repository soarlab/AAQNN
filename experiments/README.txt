To run experiments, this is recommended practice: 

1. Install virtualenv package and Python3.6+

2. Create virtual environment `venv` with Python3.6+: `virtualenv -p python3 venv`

3. Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`

4. Install listed requirements from `../requirements.txt` file: `pip install -r ../requirements.txt` (you might want to replace `tensorflow` with `tensorflow-gpu`)
